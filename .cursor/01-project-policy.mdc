description: Project-wide policy for Cursor. Language/output, branching, documentation, and safety rules.
---

## Language & Output Policy

- Code identifiers: English
- In-code comments and log messages: Turkish
- Chat responses to user: Turkish and concise
- UI text: English by default via i18n; avoid hardcoding in components

Examples:
```lisp
; Kullanıcı girdisi doğrulandı
(princ "Operation completed")
```

## Branch Workflow

- Always work on feature branches from `main`
- Do not merge to `main` directly; open PRs for review

Example commands:
```powershell
git checkout main ; git pull origin main ; git checkout -b feature/task-name
```

## Conventional Commits & SemVer

- feat → MINOR, fix/perf → PATCH, refactor/docs/chore/test → PATCH (unless breaking)
- Use CHANGELOG.md with Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed/Deprecated/Security sections

## Registry & Persistent Context

- Update `docs/registry/identifiers.json`, `docs/registry/endpoints.json`, `docs/registry/schemas.json` whenever public contracts change
- Maintain `version.md` entries per development cycle with timestamp and concise summary

## Security Defaults

- Never commit secrets; use environment or local secure storage
- Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and prefer least-privileged operations

## Documentation

- User-facing docs in Turkish; technical identifiers remain English
- Add or update docs under `docs/` when adding modules, scripts, or commands

## Import/Dependency Hygiene

- Ensure scripts reference available tools and handle errors gracefully
- Keep PowerShell scripts idempotent and non-interactive by default
