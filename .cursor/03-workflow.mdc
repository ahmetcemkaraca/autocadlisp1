## Task Flow

1. Identify task and read relevant `.github/instructions/*.md`
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Implement minimal vertical slice; keep changes scoped
4. Update registry/docs if contracts or files added/renamed
5. Commit using Conventional Commits; open PR

### Branch Commands (PowerShell)

```powershell
git checkout main ; git pull origin main ; git checkout -b feature/task-name
```

### Commit Examples

- `feat(lisp): add polyline-to-curve command usage doc`
- `fix(scripts): handle missing gh in rehydrate-context.ps1`

## Quality Gates

- Validate PowerShell scripts locally
- Smoke-test AutoLISP commands in a sample DWG when applicable
