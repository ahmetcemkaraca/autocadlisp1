## Secrets

- Never hardcode tokens, API keys, or credentials
- Prefer environment variables or OS keyring; ignore via `.gitignore`

## Validation

- Validate user inputs; sanitize outputs; log minimally necessary data

## Dependencies

- Prefer well-maintained packages; pin versions for production scripts
