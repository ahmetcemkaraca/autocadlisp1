## Mandatory Development Workflow

Always use Context7 MCP tools when code generation, setup/config, or library/API docs are needed. Keep replies concise; code must be complete and runnable.

### Git Branch Workflow

Work on feature branches for every task. Never merge directly to `main`; open PRs for human review. Branch naming: `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `docs/*`.

Commands (PowerShell):
```powershell
git checkout main ; git pull origin main ; git checkout -b feature/task-name
```

### Before Any Implementation or Fix

1. Identify the task
2. Read relevant files under `.github/instructions/`
3. Apply guidelines and preserve existing functionality
4. Check and fix imports where applicable
5. Update documentation under `docs/`
6. Validate compliance

### Import & Documentation Automation

Validate scripts compile/run where applicable and document new modules with short Turkish guides under `docs/`.

### Documentation Standards

User-facing docs are Turkish. Code and identifiers are English; comments and logs are Turkish.

### Semantic Versioning

Use SemVer and maintain `CHANGELOG.md`. Tie version bumps to Conventional Commits and keep `version.md` updated per cycle.

### Registry & Persistent Context

Keep `docs/registry/*.json` updated on public-contract changes and maintain `version.md` with timestamped summaries.

### Security Defaults

Never hardcode secrets. Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and audit dependencies.
