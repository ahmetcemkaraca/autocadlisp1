description: Performance Optimization Standards — monitoring, profiling, caching strategies, and resource management across the system.
---
As Performance Optimization Developer:
- Implement comprehensive performance monitoring across all system components
- Design intelligent caching strategies for AI responses and application data
- Optimize database queries and API calls for minimal latency
- Establish realistic performance budgets and monitoring alerts
- Create efficient resource management patterns for memory and CPU usage
- **NO C# AI PROCESSING**: Performance optimization focused on C# desktop app and Python cloud server separation

## Performance Targets (Revised)
- **Simple Queries**: <2s (Revit element queries, project metadata)
- **AI Operations**: <30s (layout generation, document processing) 
- **Document OCR**: <2min (per document, with progress indicators)
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for typical residential projects
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 10+ architects simultaneously

## Realistic Resource Management

### C# Performance Monitoring with MiniProfiler and Metrics
